The sliding window pattern is used when finding a subarray or substring satisfying a given condition, optimizing the time complexity by keeping
a window of elements

- Use the sliding window when dealing with problems concerning contiguous arrays or substrings

Sample Problem:
Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.

Example:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3

Output: 9

Explanation:
Start with the sum of the first k elements.

Slide the window one element at a time, subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element.

Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
