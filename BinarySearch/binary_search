Binary search is not only for sorted array.
It is often used in "search for answer questions" or "decision type questions"

Signs a problem can be solved using binary search algorithm
1. you're asked the minimum or maximum number that satisfies a condition
  - find the minimum number of operations, smaller radius, or max value
2. There is a monotonic property
   - if, k operations are enough then k+1 operations are too, else if k operations are false then k-1... ops are false too
   - if mid is is feasible then any smaller/larger is feasible too
3. Direct computation is hard, but checking feasibility is easier.
    - You can write a can(mid) function: “Can I do this in mid steps?”
    - This can() function runs in O(n), and binary search runs O(log range).
    - Together: O(n log range).
